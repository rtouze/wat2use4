This is a poll app I have written to have fun with node and mongoDB.  

# It seems boring but…

Yeah, not very exciting. The thing is that you create the poll, give the URL to
your friends, get a beer and watch the results growing in real time as your
fellow friends are responding.

# How does it work?

In poll answer, simply add a _#_ before the word that you want to increase the
score. Well, I hope I'm not violating a patent on this…  

For instance if the question is:

    What is the best language to build a web app?

And someone types:

    It's #python, you moron.

Then _python_ will get one point in the result (it deserves it).

# Where can I try it?

Nowhere! Acutally, it's currently working on Heroku but I have to adapt some stuff before
make it public to preevent them to take all my money if shit happen. Stay tuned.
